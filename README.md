## ANXCOR: Ambient Noise X (cross) Correlation
ANXCOR is a python library for performing seismic ambient noise crosscorrelations. It is designed to integrate easily into established datascience workflows and provide a flexible framework for developing new processing methods. Under the hood, ANXCOR relies on XArray, Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Dask to streamline its own computation. This allows ANXCOR to be deployed on everything from personal laptops to HPC clusters.


## Acknowledgements

ANXCOR would not be possible without the hard and extensive work by Obsy and Obsplus teams. Many of the University of Utah graduate students were integral to ANXCOR's development, including Kevin Mendoza, Daniel Wells, Elizabeth Berg, Sin-mei Wu, Santiago Rebale, and Kostas Gkogkas. Some of the routines provided here were first developed and refined by Dr. Fan-chi lin and his collaborators. ANXCOR was developed under the supervision of Dr. Kristine Pankow, and her work group proved integral to the success of this project
